# This is the  first time i am trying neovim and hyperland 
- There is a channel named typecraft the i am learning from and he is teaching how to setup the proper development environment using neovima nd how to setup hyprland and how it works in grim details. For now i will use nvim and hyprland and not exploring further .
It is better to get a good grip of the workflow before doing more and hence i stop at colorscheme and telescope in neovim.
